       reusability by defining a Java program efficiently. The main principles of object-oriented programming are 
        <i>abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.</i> These concepts aim to implement real-world 
    entities in programs.Using the OOPs methodology, one can enhance the code reusability and save development time.
     Easy message passing establishes communication between classes and objects.
        Using functionalities like data abstraction and hiding, OOPs ensure the security of the code.</p>
