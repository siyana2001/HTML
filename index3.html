<body><h1>About html5</h1>
    <p> HTML5 was first released in a public-facing form on 22 January 2008,[2] with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014.[4][5] Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with older software. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4 but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.[6]</p>
