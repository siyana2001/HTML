        <p> <b>Fort St. George</b> (or historically, White Town)[1] is a fortress at the coastal city of Chennai, India.
             Founded in 1639, it was the first English (later British) fortress in India.[2] The construction of the fort provided the impetus for further settlements and trading activity, in what was originally an uninhabited land.[3] Thus, it is a feasible contention to say that the city (formerly named Madras) evolved around the fortress.[4] 
            The fort currently houses the Tamil Nadu legislative assembly and other official buildings.</p>

            <p>Mahabalipuram, is a town in Chengalpattu district in the southeastern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, 
                best known for the UNESCO World Heritage Site of 7th- and 8th-century Hindu Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram. 
                It is one of the famous tourist sites in India.[1] The ancient name of the place is Thirukadalmallai.
                 It is a part of Chennai Metropolitan Area. It is a satellite town of Chennai.<br>
                 <br>


                 
                Mamallapuram was one of two major port cities in the Pallava kingdom. The town was named after Pallava king
                 Narasimhavarman I, who was also known as Mamalla. Along with economic prosperity, it became the site of a group 
                 of royal monuments, many carved out of the living rock. These are dated to the 7th and 8th centuries:
                rathas (temples in the form of chariots), mandapas (cave sanctuaries), the giant open-air rock relief
                the Descent of the Ganges, and the Shore Temple dedicated to Shiva.[1][3] The contemporary town plan
                 was established by the British Raj in 1827.[4]
